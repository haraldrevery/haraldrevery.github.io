I just asked different LLM models what is needed to survive for 6 months. These are the results:

# Perplexity

A practical 6‑month survival inventory covers food, water, cooking, warmth, hygiene, medical, tools, lighting, documents, and morale items, scaled to the number of people. Below is a compact, general-purpose checklist for one adult you can multiply by household size and adjust for climate, diet, and threats.

1 lb = 0.45359237 kg
## Calorie and water basics

Aim for about 2,000–2,400 calories and at least 2–3 liters of safe water per person per day.

- Food (target: ~360,000–430,000 calories per person for 6 months):
    
    - 80–120 lb rice, pasta, or other grains (calorie base).
        
    - 60–100 lb beans, lentils, or split peas (protein + fiber).
        
    - 20–40 lb oats or other breakfast grain.
        
    - 20–40 lb sugar, honey, or other sweeteners.
        
    - 2–5 gallons oils/fats (olive, canola, ghee, shortening, peanut butter).
        
    - 40–80 cans mixed vegetables and tomatoes.
        
    - 40–80 cans fruit or fruit in jars.
        
    - 30–60 cans meat or fish (tuna, chicken, salmon, corned beef, spam).
        
    - Shelf‑stable extras: powdered milk, bouillon, dehydrated potatoes, pasta sauces, nut butters, nuts, seeds, jam, energy bars.
        
- Water:
    
    - Absolute minimum storage goal: 1 gallon per person per day (drinking + basic hygiene) → ~180 gallons for 6 months.
        
    - Combine: stored jugs/barrels, ability to harvest (rain barrels if legal), and purification (filters, chlorine bleach or purification tablets).

## Cooking, fuel, and shelter

Assume you may lose power and normal utilities.

- Cooking:
    
    - Portable gas stove (butane/propane) or camping stove.
        
    - Backup: rocket stove, alcohol stove, or way to cook over wood/charcoal.
        
    - Sufficient fuel for at least one hot meal per day (propane bottles, butane canisters, wood/charcoal if safe to store).
        
    - Matches, lighters, and a fire steel in waterproof containers.
        
    - Basic cookware: pot with lid, pan, kettle, heat‑resistant utensils, can opener, cutting board, knives.
        
- Shelter and warmth:
    
    - Cold‑weather clothing layers for each person (base, insulating, shell).
        
    - Sleeping bags rated for your climate and insulating pads.
        
    - Wool blankets, emergency mylar blankets.
        
    - Plastic sheeting, duct tape, and cordage (paracord) for emergency repairs and drafts.
        

---

## Hygiene, sanitation, and health

Illness and poor sanitation can become the main threat over months.

- Hygiene and sanitation:
    
    - Toilet paper (at least 12–24 rolls per person), baby wipes, hand sanitizer.
        
    - Heavy‑duty trash bags (contractor grade) and ties.
        
    - Bucket with tight lid, liner bags, and absorbent (sawdust, cat litter) for emergency toilet.
        
    - Soap (bar and dish), laundry soap or washing soda, toothbrushes, toothpaste, feminine hygiene products, razors, nail clippers.
        
    - Towels, microfiber cloths, basic cleaning supplies (bleach, vinegar, spray cleaner).
        
- Medical:
    
    - Personal prescription meds (90‑day supply rotated if possible), copies of prescriptions.
        
    - Over‑the‑counter: pain reliever/fever reducer, antihistamine, anti‑diarrheal, oral rehydration salts or ingredients (salt/sugar), basic cold/flu meds.
        
    - First‑aid: assorted bandages, gauze, tape, elastic wrap, antiseptic, antibiotic ointment, tweezers, small scissors, thermometer, disposable gloves, burn gel, small splint material.
        
    - Any critical medical gear specific to household (inhalers, EpiPen, glucose meter, etc.).
        

---

## Tools, lighting, and communication

These keep you functioning safely and informed over months.

- Tools:
    
    - Multi‑tool or Swiss‑style knife.
        
    - Fixed‑blade knife, small folding saw or hatchet if you can use and store them safely.
        
    - Duct tape, zip ties, basic repair kit (screws, nails, super glue, sewing kit).
        
    - Work gloves, safety glasses, dust masks or respirators.
        
- Lighting and power:
    
    - Headlamps and flashlights (at least one per person).
        
    - Battery, solar, or crank lantern for area lighting.
        
    - Extra batteries or small solar charger/power bank system for lights, phone, radio.
        
- Communication and information:
    
    - Battery or crank AM/FM and weather radio.
        
    - Printed contact list, local maps, and written emergency plans and meet‑up points.
        

---

## Documents, security, and morale

Long disruptions are easier to endure with paperwork sorted and morale maintained.

- Documents and money:
    
    - Waterproof copies of IDs, insurance, property records, medical info, and key phone numbers.
        
    - Small amount of cash in small bills and coins.
        
- Security (adapt to local laws and comfort level):
    
    - Door/window reinforcement, basic locks.
        
    - Flashlights for perimeter checks, whistle, and simple alarm options (door wedges, battery alarms).
        
- Morale and daily life:
    
    - Comfort foods: coffee/tea, chocolate, spices, sauces, snacks.
        
    - Cards, board games, books, paper, pens, kids’ activities.
        
    - Basic tools for small projects (screwdrivers, pliers, wrench).
        

If you share how many people you are planning for, climate, and whether you expect to shelter at home or move (bug out), a tailored 6‑month item list with approximate quantities per category can be laid out for your situation.

# Gemini

Preparing for a six-month survival period is a significant undertaking. At this scale, you transition from "emergency kits" to "lifestyle management." The goal is to ensure you have high-calorie nutrition, reliable water filtration, and the tools to maintain your environment.

Here is a comprehensive inventory breakdown for one person for roughly 180 days.

---

## 1. Water (The Most Critical)

You cannot store six months of water (it would be roughly **180–360 gallons**). Instead, you need a way to create potable water.

- **Primary Filter:** A gravity-fed system (like a Berkey or Sawyer S3) capable of filtering thousands of gallons.
    
- **Backup Filter:** A portable straw or pump filter (Sawyer Squeeze or LifeStraw).
    
- **Chemical Treatment:** 2 bottles of Potable Aqua tablets or liquid bleach (unscented) for viruses.
    
- **Storage:** At least **20 gallons** of "ready-to-drink" water for immediate use.
    

## 2. Food & Nutrition

Aim for **2,000–2,500 calories per day**. Focus on shelf-stable, calorie-dense dry goods.

|Category|Item|Quantity (per person)|
|---|---|---|
|**Grains**|Rice, Oats, Pasta, Flour|100–120 lbs|
|**Proteins**|Canned Meats, Beans, Lentils|60–80 lbs|
|**Fats**|Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Peanut Butter|10–15 lbs|
|**Dairy**|Powdered Milk, Ghee|5 lbs|
|**Extras**|Salt, Sugar, Spices, Coffee/Tea|5–10 lbs|
|**Vitamins**|High-quality Multivitamins|180-day supply|
For an 80 kg (approx. 176 lbs) male in his 20s or 30s, your **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**—the calories you burn just staying alive—is roughly **1,800 to 1,900 calories per day**.

In a survival scenario (chopping wood, hauling water, or high stress), you will need **2,500 to 3,000 calories** to maintain your weight and muscle mass. If you drop below 2,000 calories, you will likely lose weight rapidly and experience "brain fog."

Here is a 180-day caloric and weight breakdown for your specific profile.

---

## Caloric Targets (180 Days)

- **Daily Target:** 2,800 kcal
    
- **6-Month Total:** 504,000 kcal
    

### Macronutrient Distribution

To maintain 80 kg of body mass, you need to prioritize protein to prevent muscle wasting and fats for hormone regulation.

| Component   | Daily Amount | 180-Day Total    | Why?                                |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Protein** | 120g – 150g  | ~25 kg (55 lbs)  | Muscle maintenance & repair.        |
| **Fats**    | 80g – 100g   | ~16 kg (35 lbs)  | High-density energy & brain health. |
| **Carbs**   | 350g – 400g  | ~68 kg (150 lbs) | Primary fuel for physical labor.    |
# Grok (xAI)
Here’s a realistic, comprehensive survival inventory for roughly 6 months of self-sufficiency for one adult (adjust quantities for family size, activity level, climate, and health needs). This assumes a shelter-in-place scenario (e.g., economic disruption, grid-down, supply chain failure, or major disaster) rather than a lightweight bug-out bag.The goal is sustainable basics — enough calories (aim for 1,800–2,200+ per day), nutrition, water, hygiene, medical care, security, and morale to maintain health and sanity without outside resupply.1. Water (The #1 Priority)

- Minimum storage: 1 gallon/person/day × 180 days = 180 gallons (drinking + basic hygiene/cooking).
- Practical approach:
    - Stored water: 30–60 gallons (rotate every 6–12 months).
    - Long-term: Rain collection barrels (50–100+ gal), purification methods.
- Purification:
    - Portable filter (e.g., Sawyer, Berkey, LifeStraw) — capable of 10,000+ gallons.
    - Backup: Bleach (unscented, 8.25% — 1 tsp per 5 gal), purification tablets, boiling setup.
- Extra: Collapsible water containers, spigot buckets.

2. Food (~540,000–720,000 total calories / 6 months)Aim for calorie-dense, long-shelf-life staples. A mix of bulk basics + variety prevents burnout.Core bulk staples (cheap, 25–30+ year shelf life when properly stored in mylar + oxygen absorbers):

|Item|Approx. Quantity (1 person, 6 mo)|Calories/day contribution|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|White rice / parboiled rice|180–220 lbs|~800–1,000|Base carb|
|Beans / lentils (mixed)|60–90 lbs|~400–600|Protein|
|Wheat berries / oats|60–100 lbs|~400–700|Versatile|
|Pasta|40–60 lbs|~300–500|Easy prep|
|Sugar / honey|30–50 lbs|~200–400|Energy + morale|
|Cooking oil / shortening|10–20 gallons|~400–600|Critical fat/calories|
|Salt (iodized + sea)|10–20 lbs|—|Preservation + electrolytes|
|Powdered milk / dairy|20–40 lbs|~200–300|Calcium/protein|
|Peanut butter / nuts|20–40 lbs|~300–500|Fat/protein|

Supplements & variety (for nutrition & sanity):

- Multivitamins (365+ tablets/person).
- Freeze-dried/freeze-dried meals (e.g., Mountain House, ReadyWise — 200–400 servings).
- Canned goods (meat, veggies, fruit, soup) — 100–200 cans.
- Comfort foods: Coffee/tea, chocolate, spices, bouillon, hard candy.

Total rough cost for bulk approach: $400–$1,200 (much cheaper than pre-packaged kits).Here are some visual examples of well-organized long-term food storage setups using 5-gallon buckets (common for bulk staples):3. Medical & Hygiene (Prevent Small Issues Becoming Deadly)

- First aid kit (expanded): Trauma supplies (tourniquet, QuickClot, chest seals), bandages, sutures, antibiotics (fish meds if legal), pain/fever meds, anti-diarrheal, antifungal.
- Prescriptions: 6+ months of any needed meds.
- Hygiene:
    - Soap, shampoo, toothpaste (6 months supply).
    - Toilet paper: 50–100 rolls.
    - Feminine products (if applicable).
    - Portable toilet + heavy-duty bags + cat litter/sawdust for waste.
- Sanitation: Bleach, hand sanitizer, buckets for washing.

4. Energy, Light & Heat

- Cooking: Propane camp stove + 20–40 lb tanks (or wood stove if rural).
- Light: LED lanterns/headlamps + 100+ AA/AAA batteries, solar lantern.
- Power: Solar panel + power station (200–500W), hand-crank radio/charger.
- Heat: Wool blankets, sleeping bag (0°F rating), propane heater (with ventilation!).

5. Security & Tools

- Self-defense: Whatever you're trained for/legally own (firearm + ammo, pepper spray, sturdy knife).
- Tools: Multi-tool, duct tape, tarps, work gloves, shovel, axe/saw.
- Fire: Multiple lighters, ferro rod, waterproof matches.

6. Morale & Misc

- Books, games, notebooks/pen.
- Cash (small bills), barter items (alcohol, ammo, hygiene).
- Important documents (copies in waterproof bag).

Quick Reality Check

- Start small — build 1–3 months first, then expand.
- Rotate food (eat & replace) to avoid waste.
- Store in cool, dry, dark place — use 5-gallon buckets + gamma lids.
- Water & calories are what usually break people first — prioritize those.

This isn't a "zombie apocalypse" list — it's for real-world, long-duration disruptions that happen somewhere almost every year. Stay safe and prepared!
